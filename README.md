# JansenRitERPInversion
This repo presents a comprehensive connectome-constrained Jansen-Rit (JR) neural mass modeling framework designed for forward electroencephalography (EEG) simulation, robust parameter inversion, and the extraction of interpretable mechanistic biomarkers. 


The framework integrates detailed local JR microcircuit dynamics with large-scale structural connectivity, employing an innovative three-network factorization of long-range connections. It leverages geometry-derived leadfields for EEG projection and utilizes a full Variational Bayesian (VB) inversion approach for all model parameters, enhanced by stochastic variational inference with backpropagation through time. The methodology is rigorously validated through a suite of reliability and identifiability assessments. Its practical utility is demonstrated through an illustrative application to event-related potentials (ERPs), specifically the N400, revealing physiologically meaningful insights into neural circuit alterations. This framework offers a powerful computational tool for advancing mechanistic understanding of brain function and dysfunction, with significant potential for applications in clinical neuroscience, neurostimulation, and psychopharmacology.
